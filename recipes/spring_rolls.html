        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These Vietnamese spring rolls are a refreshing change from the usual
            fried variety and have become a family favorite. They are a great
            summertime appetizer and delicious dipped in one or both of the
            sauces.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ounces rice vermicelli</li>
            <li>8 rice wrappers (8.5 inch diameter)</li>
            <li>8 large cooked shrimp - peeled, deveined and cut in half</li>
            <li>2 leaves lettuce, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 â…“ tablespoons chopped fresh Thai basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
                rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil.
                Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is
                tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot
                water for 1 second to soften. Lay wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp
                halves in a row across the center, add some vermicelli, lettuce,
                mint, cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on
                each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the
                wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with
                remaining ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the sauces: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce,
                garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl until well combined. Mix
                hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve rolled spring rolls with fish sauce and hoisin sauce
                mixtures.
